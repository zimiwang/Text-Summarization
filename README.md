# Text Summarization Using Advanced Neural Nets

## For more information please check the article

## Project Overview

This project delves into the application of advanced neural network architectures for the tasks of language modeling and text summarization within Natural Language Processing (NLP). It encompasses two main segments: language modeling using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks and text summarization with the PEGASUS model. By employing these sophisticated models, the project aims to enhance the accuracy and coherence of generated text summaries.

## Motivation

The rapid expansion of digital content necessitates advanced NLP techniques for efficient summarization and understanding. This project is driven by the need to improve interaction with AI through better language models and to facilitate information processing with high-quality text summarization. The ultimate goal is to benefit applications such as virtual assistants, content summarization tools, and machine translation services, thereby enhancing user experience and accessibility to information.

## Project Workflow

### Language Modeling with BiLSTM

- **Data Preparation and Preprocessing:** The initial phase focuses on preparing the input data, emphasizing the challenges of managing sequence lengths and mitigating overfitting.
- **Model Architecture:** The BiLSTM architecture is detailed, highlighting its capability to understand contexts from both past and future inputs, thanks to its bidirectional processing.
- **Implementation Challenges:** Issues such as sequence length management and model overfitting are addressed, with strategies for optimization discussed.

### Text Summarization with PEGASUS

- **Model Overview:** The PEGASUS model's architecture and its novel "gap sentence generation" pre-training objective are introduced.
- **Fine-tuning for Summarization:** Techniques for tailoring the PEGASUS model to text summarization tasks are outlined, aiming to generate contextually accurate summaries.
- **Model Evaluation:** The effectiveness of the models is assessed using ROUGE metrics, ensuring a thorough understanding of their performance in producing coherent summaries.

## Technical Details

- **Technologies Used:** The project employs Python for programming, with TensorFlow as the main framework for building and training the neural network models.
- **Key Models:** Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for language modeling and the PEGASUS model for text summarization.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** ROUGE scores, including ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L, are used to evaluate the quality of the generated summaries.
